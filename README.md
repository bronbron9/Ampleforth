# Ampleforth
Ampleforth Calculator

First time posting to github.  Not sure the .xlsx out of google sheets will work but might as well test it out.  

This is originally a google sheet file that calculates what the daily Ampleforth rebase will do to your holdings.  

Find out exaclty how many shares you will gain or lose at rebase. Just have to enter Oracle Rate, Price Target, Supply (all on the Ample Dash), and your current holdings.
