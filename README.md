# Ampleforth
Ampleforth Calculator

Just a little Sheet I put together from the Ampleforth docs to estimate what will happen to my AMPL holdings each night at 10pm (EST).  

You can find out how many shares you will gain or lose at rebase. Just have to enter Oracle Rate, Price Target, Supply (all on the Ample Dash), and your current holdings/price.

Hope it helps!
